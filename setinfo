# TODO: Implement setinfo 

# This script is used to add metadata to an existing volume. It is
# helpful when we need to keep an external, Ganeti-independent mapping
# between instances and volumes; primarily for recovery reasons. This
# is provider specific and the author of the provider chooses
# whether/how to implement this. You can just exit with 0, if you do
# not want to implement this feature, without harming the overall
# functionality of the provider.  The VOL_METADATA variable contains
# the metadata of the volume.  Currently, Ganeti sets this value to
# originstname+X where X is the instanceâ€™s name.  The script returns 0
# on success.
