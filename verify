# TODO: Implement verify

# The verify script is used to verify consistency of the external
# parameters (ext-params) (see below). The command should take one or
# more arguments denoting what checks should be performed, and return a
# proper exit code depending on whether the validation failed or
# succeeded.  Currently, the script is not invoked by Ganeti, but should
# be present for future use and consistency with gnt-os-interfaceâ€™s
# verify script.  The script should return 0 on success.
